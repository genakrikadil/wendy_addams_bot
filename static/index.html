        <h1>Explore Two Versions of my Program</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Widget Version</h2>
        <p>The widget version of our program offers a compact, embedded interface that can be placed anywhere on your website. It integrates seamlessly, giving your users the ability to interact with the chatbot in a small, convenient window without leaving the current page. It's perfect for websites looking to provide instant assistance without disrupting the user's experience.</p>
        <div class="button-container">
            <a href="/static/chatWidget.html" target="_blank">Try the Widget</a>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Full-Screen Version</h2>
        <p>The full-screen version provides a more immersive and expansive experience. By opening in its own dedicated window, it allows for a larger, more detailed interaction. This version is ideal for situations where the conversation needs to be the center of attention, offering a deeper level of engagement with the chatbot.</p>
        <div class="button-container">
            <a href="/static/chatInterface.html" target="_blank">Try the Full-Screen</a>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="difference-description">
        <h2>The Differences Between Widget and Full-Screen Versions</h2>
        <p>The main distinction between the widget and full-screen versions lies in their presentation and purpose. The widget is designed for subtle integration into your existing website or app, offering quick, on-demand access to the chatbot without interrupting the user’s flow. It’s perfect for light interactions where users can get quick answers.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the full-screen version provides an uninterrupted, dedicated space for interaction. It’s ideal when users need to engage more deeply with the chatbot, offering a richer experience and allowing the interface to utilize the full screen for more complex conversations or tasks.</p>
        <p>Both versions use the same underlying technology, but they are optimized for different use cases. Whether you prefer the compactness and convenience of the widget or the immersive experience of the full-screen interface, each version is designed to offer the best user experience tailored to your needs.</p>
